A web-based prototype to help determine the playful interaction of playing a song with a keypress.
 
# HOW TO PLAY
Press any key to begin playing a tune. 
Keep pressing a key to advance the rest of the tune. 
After a certain point, the full song will come in and you keep pressing to advance, until the song just plays.

# HOW IT WAS CONSTRUCTED
The tune is loaded and is split into multiple cues. When a key is pressed, the tune plays until the next cue. When the tune reaches it's last cue, the full song is loaded. The same thing happens with the full song's cues.
